<h3 class="red_bg py-2 text-center">Company Background</h3>

<p>
  Xivoni is an actuarial consulting firm formed in 2016. 
  Xivoni is a registered service provider (RSP) by the Actuarial Society of South Africa (ASSA), 
  registration number: RSP142/2019. Xivoni means mirror in Xitsonga. 
  This word encompasses the idea of people working together to fulfil a common goal. 
  We believe in walking with our clients to understand their problems,
  develop long lasting solutions and to communicate effectively so that the solutions 
  are successfully implemented. Xivoni is a 100% black youth owned (25% black female owned) 
  and controlled company.

  <h3  class="red_bg py-2 text-center">Our Journey</h3>
  
  <p>
    Since its establishment in 2016, Xivoni has assisted firms of various sizes in South Africa
    and in other African jurisdictions on an advisory basis to improve their product offerings,
    with regulatory compliance and establishing themselves in the market. <br>

    Xivoni’s partners are Actuarial Fellows in various jurisdictions 
    (incl. South Africa, the UK, Kenya and Tanzania) and this enables the firm
    to stay close to developments in these markets. Over the last few years, 
    Xivoni has continued to grow its staff complement in order to meet
    the increasing needs of its clients. Xivoni’s approach of walking 
    the journey with its clients has assisted it to deliver exceptional quality due
    to its ability to focus its attention on the detail. <br>
           
    Recognising our journey thus far,
    Xivoni holds a strong position on accepting client engagements. 
    We do not accept engagements that are beyond the scope of our abilities
    as this is counter to our values. Our agility and responsiveness
    to client needs is an aspect that we believe has been the cornerstone
    of our success and has allowed our firm to gradually develop mutual trust
    with our clients.
