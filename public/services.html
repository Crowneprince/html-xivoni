<h3 id="micro-insurance_main">Micro-insurance</h3>
<p>
  Our micro insurance service offering aims to support the insurer that
   is targeting the low income segment of the market. The microinsurance landscape
    has been evolving in recent times and presents an opportunity for new entrants 
    to design new and innovative products and sell these products on their own microinsurance licence.
    In addition, the recent advances in technology affords the existing micro insurers an opportunity 
    to engage with their clients more seamlessly using more digital methods for distribution 
    and customer engagement. Xivoni has partnered with clients on their journey to obtaining their 
    own micro insurance licence thereby reducing their operating costs. Xivoni has also been involved 
    in the design of more digital methods that improve an insurers interaction with their clients and brokers. 
    In addition to the licence application assistance we provide to our clients, 
    we also offer ongoing actuarial services including outsourced head of actuarial control function (HAF) services.

    Data is becoming increasingly ubiquitous and is widely 
    considered as a key commodity for businesses and the public sector alike. 
    The advent of big data provides an opportunity for firms to harness large data sets 
    to glean information that can reduce their operational costs and improve their understanding 
    of their customers behaviour and concurrently unearth new markets that were previously under served. 
    Xivoni has worked with firms to design loyalty programs that match the needs of their clients 
    and advised large content producers to pivot from their traditional business construct and adapt 
    to the on demand models that customers are in favour of. Xivoni’s data analytics offering seeks 
    to augment client’s efforts in re designing their product offering and re imagining their
     marketing strategies to keep pace with the changing needs of their customers.
