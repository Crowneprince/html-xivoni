<p>
  Our micro insurance service offering aims to support the insurer that
   is targeting the low income segment of the market. The microinsurance landscape
    has been evolving in recent times and presents an opportunity for new entrants 
    to design new and innovative products and sell these products on their own microinsurance licence.
    In addition, the recent advances in technology affords the existing micro insurers an opportunity 
    to engage with their clients more seamlessly using more digital methods for distribution 
    and customer engagement. Xivoni has partnered with clients on their journey to obtaining their 
    own micro insurance licence thereby reducing their operating costs. Xivoni has also been involved 
    in the design of more digital methods that improve an insurers interaction with their clients and brokers. 
    In addition to the licence application assistance we provide to our clients, 
    we also offer ongoing actuarial services including outsourced head of actuarial control function (HAF) services.

                <p>
                  Actuarial consulting is a specialist discipline that requires the services of professionals 
                  that have been trained to perform complex financial modelling of contingent events. 
                  This skillset allows us to evaluate potential risks that could occur in the future and 
                  evaluate a monetary value that enables the risk adjusted economic value to be understood 
                  by the management teams of firms. The actuary’s role is to analyse past data and use that 
                  information to assess the financial implications for specific strategies that an 
                  organisation would pursue. The actuary must provide useful information that enables 
                  the management team to take considered decisions as they steer the firm towards 
                  financial prosperity. At Xivoni, we believe that a rigorous approach to understanding 
                  a client’s unique circumstances, the markets they service, and their strategic goals 
                  is key to providing an advisory service that adds value. Xivoni’s broad set of skills 
                  and experience places it in a unique position to meet the needs of our clients 
                  and improve their organisations financial performance. Xivoni’s professionals 
                  have extensive experience across the spectrum of actuarial valuations, capital management, 
                  product development and pricing and have been involved in advising clients on 
                  the adoption of IFRS 17, IFRS 9 and the Solvency Assessment and Management (SAM) regime.

    Performance Optimisation</h3>
 
  <p class="mt-3">
    Data is becoming increasingly ubiquitous and is widely considered as a key commodity 
    for businesses and the public sector alike. The advent of big data provides an opportunity 
    for firms to harness large data sets to glean information that can reduce their operational 
    costs and improve their understanding of their customers behaviour and concurrently unearth 
    new markets that were previously under served. Xivoni has worked with firms to design loyalty programs 
    that match the needs of their clients and advised large content producers to pivot from 
    their traditional business construct and adapt to the on demand models that customers are in favour of. 
    Xivoni’s data analytics offering seeks to augment client’s efforts in re designing their product offering 
    and re imagining their marketing strategies to keep pace with the changing needs of their customers.

  <h3 class="text-center mt-3" id="ERP_main">Enterprise Risk <br> Management</h3>
 
  <p class="mt-3">
    The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) discipline requires an organisation to continuously identify, 
    monitor and assess risks so as to improve its preparedness to withstand adverse events 
    that may hamper the effective functioning of the organisation and limit the negative impact 
    on earnings and the on going solvency of the firm. Xivoni’s professionals have extensive experience 
    in designing risk and capital frameworks, implementing the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA), 
    formulating Recovery and Resolution plans (RRP) and conducting internal audits 
    of an organisation’s processes and plans. For firms that are in the business of accepting risks 
    on their balance sheets, this is a key area that must be continually assessed to ensure it is responsive 
    to emerging risks in the operating environment.

  <h3 class="text-center mt-3" id="balance_main">Balance Sheet <br> Management</h3>
 
  <p class="mt-3">
    Firms in the financial services industry are compelled to have relatively large balance sheets due 
    to the regulatory requirements to hold a strong capital base to ensure that adequate reserves 
    are held to meet client obligations in severe market shocks and on the occurrence 
    of extreme insurance risk events. Managing a large balance sheet is thus a key competence 
    that can add accretive value to the ROE/ RoRAC for these firms and is a key competitive attribute 
    that can be leveraged to improve the risk adjusted returns of these firms. An important area 
    for finance teams is the need to reduce the cost of capital thereby improving the economic value 
    of writing new business and enabling the firm to price its products competitively. 
    Xivoni’s partners have been involved in large corporate finance transactions, 
    evaluating investment decisions of the shareholder portfolio and have over seen the ALM functions 
    of large firms and are well placed to support organisations in developing effective investment strategies. 
    Xivoni’s actuaries have a wealth of experience in reinsurance which is a key area that can improve 
    a firm’s value advantage.
